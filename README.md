## Installation

I used the tools that I had on my computer, like Git, Vscode, Github, and Google. First, I cloned the repo into my local file, made a GitHub repo, and named both the local and global repo the "simplyannz-web-portfolio". I opened the file in my VScode and started coding the project, and used Chrome developer tools to live to check the website for errors and stuff. Then I push it into my GitHub for deployment.
