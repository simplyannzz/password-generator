# Password Generator

## Description

For challenge 3, we are supposed to create a page where we could generate random passwords with different criteria, such as numbers, symbols, and uppercase or lowercase letters that the users could choose to have in this password. I wanted the page to have something where the users could put their inputs of what they want for a password, so I added checkboxes and a range button for the value of letters in the HTML. Then we added the strings and arrays in the Javascript.

## Installation

I used the tools that I had on my computer, like Git, Vscode, Github, and Google. First, I cloned the repo into my local file, made a GitHub repo, and named both the local and global repo the "simplyannz-web-portfolio". I opened the file in my VScode and started coding the project, and used Chrome developer tools to live to check the website for errors and stuff. Then I push it into my GitHub for deployment.
